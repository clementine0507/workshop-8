### Notes

It's best to tap into the json file to view it when using it to avoid errors.

Imported a joke API and added two variables, one for intro and one for punchline, which correspond to setup and delivery in the json file.

Added a point in time to generate a joke every five seconds.

Apply two values to put in the file, and take the parent file with you when you enter it, e.g. current_units.temperature_2m

Declare the new variable first with the URL.

Then add the file and the parent file to the self-fabricated function. Finally, export the data in text.

The third set of data is used here, and since there are three levels of files, middle brackets are used. Because the third level of documentation is an array, references to a few pieces of data are written in the middle parentheses.

#### Processing

I tried to add two extra values based on the video.

In my workshop 7, I learned how stars are drawn, so I wanted to make stars to the mix. When it's daytime the star is black and when it's nighttime the star is yellow.

Although the white star was successfully generated, the color did not change according to the condition I gave. After checking, it was dayNight that was missing a condition.

We will get randomly positioned stars with each refresh, and the color will change according to Day or Night.

##### reflection

Most of what I’ve learned is universally applicable. As long as the sequence is correct and the conditions don’t conflict, multiple functions can be executed on a single page without issues. This realization has made me more confident in structuring my code efficiently. By carefully planning the logic and ensuring different functions work harmoniously, I can maximize reusability and streamline the development process.
