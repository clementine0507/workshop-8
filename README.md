### Notes

It's best to tap into the json file to view it when using it to avoid errors.

Imported a joke API and added two variables, one for intro and one for punchline, which correspond to setup and delivery in the json file.

Added a point in time to generate a joke every five seconds.

Apply two values to put in the file, and take the parent file with you when you enter it, e.g. current_units.temperature_2m

Declare the new variable first with the URL.

Then add the file and the parent file to the self-fabricated function. Finally, export the data in text.

The third set of data is used here, and since there are three levels of files, middle brackets are used. Because the third level of documentation is an array, references to a few pieces of data are written in the middle parentheses.
